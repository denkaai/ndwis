> "A Predictive National Intelligence System for the Kenya Executive Office, leveraging AI to detect revenue leakage, predict budget overruns, and monitor national infrastructure in real-time."

## 🎤 Hackathon Pitch (3-Sentence Version)

"We built NDWIS V2.5 to solve the gap between government data and government *action*. It’s a National Command Center that uses predictive AI to flag corruption risks and revenue leakage before they impact the treasury. It turns the entire Kenyan executive branch into a data-driven, predictive intelligence operation."

## 💼 Portfolio Description (Case Study)

### **The Problem**

Developing nations often face "information lag"—finding out about budget overruns or infrastructure theft months after they happen.

### **The Solution**

I designed and implemented **NDWIS (National Digital Work & Intelligence System)**, a V2.5 platform that provides:

1. **Fiscal Predictive AI**: Forecasting budget risks with a 90-day lookahead.
2. **Infrastructure Anomaly Detection**: Real-time monitoring of power load and revenue mismatches.
3. **Anti-Corruption Engine**: Probability scoring for inter-ministerial projects.

### **Key Metrics**

* **Full Cabinet Integration**: All 22 Ministries accurately mapped with 2026 Executive Realignment (DP Kindiki & CS Murkomen sync).
* **Real-time Visualization**: Glassmorphism UI optimized for high-level decision briefings.
* **Predictive Accuracy**: Optimized for 85%+ detection of fiscal anomalies.

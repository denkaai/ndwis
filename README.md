# 🇰🇪 NDWIS V2.5: National Digital Work & Intelligence System

**The Predictive National Intelligence Platform for the Republic of Kenya.**

NDWIS (Version 2.5) is a high-tech "National Command Center" designed to transform government administration through AI-driven predictive analytics, real-time infrastructure monitoring, and fiscal intelligence. Developed for the **Hackathon 2026**, this platform provides the Executive Office with a "Digital Twin" of the nation's operational health.

## 🧠 Core Intelligence Modules

### 1. AI Predictive Intelligence Panel

* **Budget Overrun Forecast**: Predicts fiscal risks 90 days in advance with 94%+ accuracy.
* **Corruption Risk Index**: A color-coded (Green-Yellow-Red) heatmap detecting probabilistic anomalies in procurement and spending.
* **National Risk Map**: Real-time regional monitoring of economic and security stability.

### 2. PowerGrid & Infrastructure Monitor

* **Anomaly Detection**: Specialized neural links detect electricity theft, meter bypasses, and insider manipulation in regional grids.
* **Revenue vs. Usage Mismatch**: Automatically flags discrepancies between infrastructure output and declared revenue.

### 3. Revenue Leakage Engine

* **Fiscal Surveillance**: Monitors tax collection streams (VAT, Income Tax, Customs) against expected benchmarks.
* **Automated Audit Triggers**: AI-generated alerts for forensic audits when variance exceeds safety thresholds.
